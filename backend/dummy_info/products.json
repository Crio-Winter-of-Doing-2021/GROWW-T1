		"questions": ["How do Small-Cap Equity Funds work?","Who should invest in Small-cap Equity Fund?"],
		"answers": ["Small-cap stocks are generally defined as the stock of publicly traded companies that have a market capitalisation ranging less than Rs 500 crore. Technically speaking as underlying companies are young and seek to expand aggressively, they are more volatile and vulnerable to losses during downtime in the market. In a small-cap fund, the fund manager can have exposure to stocks of small companies in the range of 65%-90%.",
							"The investor who has the capacity to stomach higher risks can consider investing in this category. One must have a small composition allocated in his/her portfolio towards small-cap funds. When an investor is creating a stock portfolio for himself, it is vital to have a benchmark against which you can compare your returns. This allows an investor to gauge the actual performance of his or her portfolio accurately. The best strategy to reduce risk can be investing through a SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)."
